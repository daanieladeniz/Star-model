# Star-model
This project consists on the making of a stellar-interior numerical model. To do so, we are going to solve the four main equations governing the stellar interior. These are: the mass continuity equation, the hydrostatic equilibrium equation, the energetic equilibrium equation and the energy transportation. To solve this equations, we are going to follow a mix strategy: first, we integrate from the surface to the center of the star, and then from the center to the surface. Once we have donde this, we are going to join the solutions in the limit between the radiative zone and the convective core. The integration is done by a prediction-correction algorithm. Once the equations are programmed and solved, we have acomplished a complete model. Nevertheless, the union between the two solutions is poor. Consequently, we adjust the initial parameters in order to find a smoth joinig. Lastly, we clasify our star and put it in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.
